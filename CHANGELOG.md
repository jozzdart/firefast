## 0.1.6

- **Fixed Firestore binary data writing bug due to incorrect generic inference:**

  - Reworked all generic default parameters in `FirePortOperation`, `FromFire`, and `ToFire` to explicitly use `EmptyValueGuard<T>` instead of inferring `EmptyValueGuard<Null>`.
  - This bug caused runtime type errors (`Uint8List is not a subtype of Null`) when writing binary (`Uint8List`) fields to Firestore.

- **Added tests** to validate Firestore binary field writes and ensure proper generic handling.

## 0.1.5

- Fixed iOS Firestore binary field bug:
  - Improved `BlobFireAdapter` to handle both `Blob` and `List<dynamic>` types when reading data
  - Prevented type casting error on iOS when decoding binary Firestore fields

## 0.1.4

- Updated README

## 0.1.3

- Changed operation function return types for better error handling:
  - All operations (write, overwrite, delete) now return `String?`:
    - Returns error message as String if operation fails
    - Returns null if operation succeeds
  - Read operations now return `OperationOutputReader?`:
    - Returns null if read fails or data doesn't exist
    - Returns `OperationOutputReader` with data if successful
  - Previously all operations were void, making error handling more difficult

## 0.1.2

- Updated `prf` dependency to version 2.2.4 from 2.1.3

## 0.1.1

- Added new operation guard implementations:
  - `OperationLimiterBase` - Base interface for limit-based guards with `isLimited()` and `update()` methods
  - `RateLimiterGuard` - Implementation using `PrfRateLimiter` for rate-limited operations
  - `CooldownGuard` - Implementation using `PrfCooldown` for cooldown-based operation limiting

## 0.1.0

### Major update: **Unified `FireValue` model across all datasources**:

- Replaced `FirestoreField<T>` and `RealtimeField<T>` with a single, universal `FireValue<T>`:
  - Cleaner, scalable design
  - Works seamlessly with Firestore, Realtime Database, and future datasources (Remote Config, Storage, etc.)
  - Strong type safety with native Dart types (`int`, `bool`, `double`, `String`, `DateTime`, `Uint8List`, `Map<String, dynamic>`)
  - Built-in flexible `toFire` and `fromFire` operations:
    - Optional definition
    - Supports simple `.toFire()` for basic values
    - Supports full custom logic for complex data transformations
- Automatic adapter resolution based on database and data type:
  - Example: `Uint8List` is automatically stored as Firestore `Blob` or encoded for Realtime Database
  - `DateTime` automatically mapped to Firestore `Timestamp`
  - Maps automatically handled for Firestore/Realtime JSON structures
- Enhanced field behavior:
  - Native `.write()`, `.read()`, `.overwrite()`, `.delete()` operations without needing manual path or data management
  - No runtime string keys or casting needed â€” everything defined once and type-safe
- Introduced **Operation Guards**:
- Optional conditions to block or allow read, write, delete operations dynamically
- Example use-cases: rate limiting, permission checks, feature flags
- Introduced **Value Guards**:
- Field-level dynamic blocking logic based on current app state or external conditions
- Allow fine-grained control for reading or writing specific fields
- Clean and predictable API philosophy:
- All operations (`read`, `write`, `delete`) are **void** by design:
  - Data handling logic is defined once at field creation
  - No runtime fetching or ad-hoc serialization logic
  - Strict separation of concerns between field definition and operations
- Seamless upgrade path:
- Minimal migration from older `FirestoreField` / `RealtimeField` required
- Just redefine using `FireValue` and retain same structure and behavior

### Core Models Rewrite

- Continued rewrite of core library with focus on core/models:

    - Provides a consistent interface for bidirectional data flow with Firebase

    - `isValid<T>` function allows conditional validation of field values before database operations
    - `shouldCancelAll<T>` function enables cancellation of entire operations based on single field conditions
    - Both validation functions are composable and can be chained together for complex validation logic

    - `ToFireDelegate<T>` handles outgoing data preparation before adapter conversion
    - `FromFireDelegate<T>` processes incoming data after adapter conversion
    - Complete control over data transformation at each step of the Firebase interaction

    - Type-safe getters prevent runtime type errors
    - Detailed error messages when type conversion fails
  - Added `FieldTypeMismatchException` for clearer error detection when type conversion fails
